# CopyPaste

in this repo I collect useful stuff. I will accumulate these over time.

You can use these things as a copy template.

With many libs I had the problem that
a) it's hard to customize the behavior if I don't like the way it works
b) I don't always need all the functions.

copy paste will solve these problems.

the repo is for my personal used, you can use if you like.
